<!-- Welcome Message -->
<div>
  <p>Hello and welcome to my Github.  My projects are organized into two categories.  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal projects</strong>: Which contain projects for my own self study and interests.</li>
      <li><strong>Teaching projects</strong>: A collection of projects that I created for concept demonstration and recreation with my students.  These projects may be unpolished, contain bugs, and lack proper documentation and error handling as they are intended to focus on one or several key concepts.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
